      #
      # When CFPA is used to advance LC state, then application code should implement hooks, to revert CFPA_LC_STATE field to 0x3 to bring the device back to OEM_DEVELOP state (0x03).  One such example is a GPIO interrupt handler invoked on a button press which modified the CFPA_LC_STATE to 0x3.
      #
