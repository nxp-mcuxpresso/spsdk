      REC_IMG_EXT1: '0x000000'  # Offset: 8b, Width: 24b, Description: Bitmap mask to indicate sectors included in recovery image. Recovery image is programmed in BANK1_IFR0. But if the image size is more than 32KB, this field can be used to indicate sectors to include in recovery image. 
      # ROM will configure flash protection setting for these sectors the same as BANK1_IFR0 before exiting to user code. 
      # The protection settings are managed through CMPA.OEM_BANK1_IFR0_PROT. The lower 8 sectors are excluded from this mask to avoid conflicts with dual image boot feature.
  QUICK_SET_GPIO_0: # Drive GPIO 0 port [31:0] pins high after reset. 
# Each bit corresponds to the pin in GPIO port 0. When set ROM drives the corresponding pin high as soon as possible. By default most pins come-up as tri-stated inputs. 
# This feature allows customer to specify active drive pins soon after reset instead of waiting till complete boot. 
# Note, if a pin is selected in both QUICK_SET_GPIO_0 and QUICK_CLR_GPIO_0 fields then pin will be set to high-level with quick transition to low.
