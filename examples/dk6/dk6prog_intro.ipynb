    "\n",
    "DK6 Programming tool also known as DK6Prog is an alternative tool to \"JN51xx Production Flash Programmer\" (https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3099.pdf). DK6Prog is part of the SPSDK and written in Python. DK6 is a name that was given to development kit for K32W, JN51xx and QN90xx devices. (https://www.nxp.com/products/wireless/multiprotocol-mcus/advanced-development-kit-for-k32w061-and-jn5189-88:IOTZTB-DK006)\n",

    "DK6 development kit is utilizing FTDI chip for sending ISP sequence in GPIO bitbang mode.\n",
