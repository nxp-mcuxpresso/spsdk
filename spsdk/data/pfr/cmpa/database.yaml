        description: ROTKH field is compounded by 12 32-bit fields and contains Root key
          table hash. For ECC P-256 keys RKTH is a 32-bit SHA-256 digest of four
          SHA-256 digests computed over four OEM public keys (OEM has four
          private-public key pairs in case one of its private keys becomes
          compromised) or in case that ECC P-384 keys are used, RKTH is 48-bit
          SHA-384 digest.
