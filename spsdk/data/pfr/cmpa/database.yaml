            ROTKH field is compounded by 12 32-bit fields and contains Root key

            SHA-256 digests computed over four OEM public keys (OEM has four
            private-public key pairs in case one of its private keys becomes
            compromised) or in case that ECC P-384 keys are used, RKTH is 48-bit
            SHA-384 digest.

            ROTKH field is compounded by 12 32-bit fields and contains Root key table hash.
            Root of Trust Key Hash is SHA256 or SHA384 of RoTK public. Hash algorithm is selected
            based on RoTK EC type (secp256r1 -> SHA256 or secp384r1 -> SHA384).
            Same RoTKs and RoTKTH values are shared between debug authentication, SB3.1 firmware updates
            container and signed boot image based on CMPA.RoTKx_Usage.

          description: CUST_MK_SK key blob.
            CUST_MK_SK is stored in form of RFC3394 blob and it is used by bootloader to decrypt SB3.1 encryption key during processing of SB file by bootloader.
            CUST_MK_SK is generated during device provisioning process by HSM_KEY_GEN (random key) or by HSM_STORE_KEY (user defined key) commands.
            To store this key into CMPA, SB_STORE_KEY command should be used.
