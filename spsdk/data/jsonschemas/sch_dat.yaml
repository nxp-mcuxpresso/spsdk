        A unique identifier for a set of SoCs that require no SoC-specific differentiation in
        their debug authentication. The main usage is to allow a different set of debug
        domains and options to be negotiated between the device configuration and
        credentials. A class can contain just a single revision of a single SoC model, if the
        granularity of debug control warrants it.

  There are two ways how sign the final DC data blob.\n
  \n
  1. The 'signer' option is available to specify the signature provider configuration or path to a private key.  \n
  The 'signer' option provides a standardized interface for external signing solutions that works  \n
  consistently across all SPSDK applications.  \n
  Previous options like 'rotk' and 'sign_provider'/'signProvider' are no longer supported  \n
  \n
  2. For case that Debug Credential files are generated in untrusted environment (without access to RoT private keys),\n
  there is option to use plugin (example how to create own plugin is in: ./SPSDK/examples/dat/hsm/). The plugin\n
  has simple interface that allows handle DC data blob into plugin with index of RoT meta public key to get back signed\n
  DC image.\n
  \n
  Those options are exclusive, so only one option could be used to sign the DC.\n
