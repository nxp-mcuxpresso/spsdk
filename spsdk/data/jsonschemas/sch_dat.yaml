      title: Device SoC Class
      description:
        A unique identifier for a set of SoCs that require no SoC-specific differentiation in
        their debug authentication. The main usage is to allow a different set of debug
        domains and options to be negotiated between the device configuration and
        credentials. A class can contain just a single revision of a single SoC model, if the
        granularity of debug control warrants it.

      description:
        A CC (constraint) value that is a bit mask, and whose bits are used in an
        SoCC-specific manner. These bits are typically used for controlling which debug
        domains are accessed via the authentication protocol, but device-specific debug
        options can be managed in this way also.

      description:
        A value that is passed through the authentication protocol, which is not interpreted
        by the protocol but is instead made visible to the application being debugged. A
        credential beacon is associated with a DC and is therefore vendor/RoT-signed. An
        authentication beacon is provided and signed by the debugger during the
        authentication process.

        DAC, the field in this DC, and any additional RoT state that is not stored within the
        device. This allows different RoT identification, management and revocation
        solutions to be handled.

        authentication process will fail.

  There are two ways how sign the final DC data blob.\n
  \n
  1. In case that you is available private pair for rot_meta with index rot_id just use first simple style\n
  to use it by rotk key. As a second way to do same is use sign_provider (or signProvider - both are accepted) option with 'type=file'.\n
  \n
  2. For case that Debug Credential files are generated in untrusted environment (without access to RoT private keys),\n
  there is option to use plugin (example how to create own plugin is in: ./SPSDK/examples/dat/hsm/). The plugin\n
  has simple interface that allows handle DC data blob into plugin with index of RoT meta public key to get back signed\n
  DC image.\n
  \n
  Those options are exclusive, so only one option could be used to sign the DC.\n
