      description:
        A unique identifier for a set of SoCs that require no SoC-specific differentiation in
        their debug authentication. The main usage is to allow a different set of debug
        domains and options to be negotiated between the device configuration and
        credentials. A class can contain just a single revision of a single SoC model, if the
        granularity of debug control warrants it.

        credential beacon is associated with a DC and is therefore vendor/RoT-signed. An

  There are two ways how sign the final DC data blob.\n
  \n
  1. In case that you is available private pair for rot_meta with index rot_id just use first simple style\n
  to use it by rotk key. As a second way to do same is use sign_provider (or signProvider - both are accepted) option with 'type=file'.\n
  \n
  2. For case that Debug Credential files are generated in untrusted environment (without access to RoT private keys),\n
  there is option to use plugin (example how to create own plugin is in: ./SPSDK/examples/dat/hsm/). The plugin\n
  has simple interface that allows handle DC data blob into plugin with index of RoT meta public key to get back signed\n
  DC image.\n
  \n
  Those options are exclusive, so only one option could be used to sign the DC.\n

        generation and signing.
        When credential beacon non-zero value is used in this field, ROM defers opening debug access to user
        application. The result of the authentication process is written to DBG_FEATURES register while the
        user application after doing its extended processing, such as clean-up of critical keys and secrets, should
        copy the value to DBG_FEATURES_DP register to enable the debug access.
