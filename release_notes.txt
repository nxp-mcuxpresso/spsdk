Release Notes for Secure Provisioning SDK
==========================================
Secure Provisioning SDK (SPSDK) is a unified, reliable, and easy-to-use SW library. It targets a wide
portfolio of NXP MCUs, providing a solid foundation from quick customer prototyping up to
production deployment. The library allows the user to connect and communicate with a device,
configure the device, prepare, download and upload data, including security operations. It is
delivered in the form of a python library and command-line applications.
